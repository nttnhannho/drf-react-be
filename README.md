Hello, and welcome to the  first tutorial in this Django Rest Framework Series. In the following series of tutorials we will go through the Django Rest Framework and in addition build a React application to consume our Django Rest API. In this tutorial we work through a little bit of API theory then start to build a simple application in Django - based around a blog type of application. We move through the gears in Django then move across to React where we build an application to consume our new Django API.
